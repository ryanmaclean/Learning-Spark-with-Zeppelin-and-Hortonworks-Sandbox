# Learning Spark with Zeppelin and Hortonworks Sandbox
Learning Spark with the Zeppelin notebook from the Hortonworks Sandbox VM

I've created this repo in order to catalog the differences between the setup I used and the one presented in the Eduonix Spark course as I found it much simpler though Zeppelin may not have been in the sandbox at the time of course creation. 

## Getting Started 

You'll need to have either VMware or Virtualbox environments installed already. 

On macOS, this can be done via [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/):

```
brew install virtualbox
```

OR

```
brew install vmware-fusion # this will be a 30 day trial unless you have a license
```

On Windows, the excellent Chocolatey comes to the rescue:

```
choco install virtualbox`
```

OR

```
choco install vmware-workstation # this will be a 30 day trial unless you have a license
```

### Download the Hortonwork Sandbox VM

### Start the VM

### Connect to the Sandbox via SSH

### Change the SSH Password

### Change the Ambari Password

### Open Zeppelin in Your Browser
